Instead I’ve tried to hierarchize them, so that you won’t encounter a term you don’t already know as you go down the page.</p>\n\n<p>##Union\n A trade union (also sometimes called a labor union or just a <em>union</em>) is a group of workers in the same industry who work together to improve their conditions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/trade-union\">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> on the definition of a union</p>\n\n<p>##Collective Bargaining\nCollective bargaining is the process of negotiations between people who represent workers and people who represent their employers. Some of the things they might negotiate include hiring practices, promotions, pay, and working hours, to name but a few.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/collective-bargaining\">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> on collective bargaining</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"strike\">Strike</h2>\n<p>A strike is when a group of employees refuse to work. Often a strike is used as leverage in negotiations with employers, or sometimes the government.</p>\n\n<p>A strike is not spontaneous. Normally, all members of the union calling for a strike will vote on whether they want to strike or not. If the majority wins, the strike is planned in advance. The members who voted against are normally also required to participate in the strike.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/strike-industrial-relations\">Encylopedia Britannica</a> on strikes</p>\n\n<p>##Walkout\nAs opposed to a strike, a walkout is often spontaneous. The union doesn’t always vote on whether or not to walk out. In the case of a strike, they will nearly always vote.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes the words “strike” and “walkout” are used interchangeably to refer to a situation, but the words on their own mean different things.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"picket\">Picket</h2>\n<p>To picket is to stand outside a building to prevent other workers from going inside. In the context of a strike, it is often used to enforce the strike. As a noun, “picket” refers to the groups of people engaging in this activity.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/picket\">Cambridge Dictionary</a> on picketing.</p>\n\n<p>##Picket line\nA picket line is the metaphorical line drawn at the picket in front of the place of work.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"labor-dispute\">Labor dispute</h2>\n<p>A disagreement between and employer and employees about anything related to the work, or with regards to the process of collective bargaining itself.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thelawdictionary.org/labor-dispute/\">The Law Dictionary</a> on labor disputes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dues\">Dues</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"closed-shop\">Closed shop</h2>\n<p>A place of employment where all employees must belong to a union. Closed shops are illegal in the United States. In many contracts, however, non-union employees will pay an “agency” fee, since they also benefit from the bargaining done by the union.</p>",

Due to Sass limitation, I don’t have variable hoisting feature like native CSS or Less at hand, so I have to create two user defined stylesheets:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">assets/_scss/_variables.scss</code> - This file should contain only Sass variables defined in theme Curtana. It will be loaded at the topmost of theme stylesheet <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">app.scss</code>.</li>\n  <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">assets/_scss/_user.scss</code> - where users create style customization.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From 2.0.0, Almace Scaffolding still has the ability to use Less with Grunt.js, however it’s wise to write your theme in Sass for better future compatibility.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d like to stick with the Less version:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>v1.1.11 will be the last version that supports Less.</li>\n  <li>Less version of theme Curtana will be avaiable as <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">amsf/amsf-curtana-less</code>.</li>\n</ul>",
